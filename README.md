## Dataset

This project is based on the KDDcup'99 dataset, a network traffic dataset widely used for research and acedemic purposes.

## Algorithms

For this project, we compared the foolowing algorithms:

- [Naive Bayes](Notebooks/ML_IDS_NAIVE_BAYES.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression](Notebooks/ML_PROJECT_LOGISTIC_REGRESSION.ipynb)
- [Support Vector Machine](Notebooks/ML_PROJECT_SVM.ipynb)
- [K-Nearest Neighbors](Notebooks/ML_PROJECT_KNN.ipynb)
- [Random Forest](Notebooks/ML_Project_RandomForest.ipynb)
- [Decision Tree](Notebooks/ML_PROJECT_DecisionTree.ipynb)
